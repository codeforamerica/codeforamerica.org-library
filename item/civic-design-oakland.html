<H2>About This Session</H2>
<p>Real change and innovation begins with understanding people's needs, wants, and values â€” as much for those inside government as for those they serve. When building 21st century government services, human-centered design must be at the heart of decisionmaking.<br />
That's what motivated Kiran Jain, City Attorney for the City of Oakland and founder of the Civic Design Lab, to hold a series of workshops in Oakland focused on using design processes to rethink a cumbersome government process that touches many departments and agencies: Special Event Permitting. Bringing together colleagues from the Police Department to the communications office, they collaborated to analyze, ideate, design, and prototype a new streamlined permitting process that works better for everyone.<br />
Join us for an online presentation and Q&A with Kiran Jain to learn how the design workshop worked in Oakland, what was achieved, and how you could adapt this approach in your own government organization to be applied to a civic design issue that affects you.</p>
<p>This session originally aired January 15, 2014.</p>
