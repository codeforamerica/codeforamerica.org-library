  summary_txt: CfA's Director of Community Organizing Catherine Bracy spoke at TedCity2.0
    in the fall of 2013. Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion.
    As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force
    for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded
    projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City â€” and makes a compelling case that
    we all have what it takes to get involved.
